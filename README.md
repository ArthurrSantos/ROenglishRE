## ROenglishRE

Branch: reorganize
- I still need to research a few files to give proper compatibility for them
- Need to recheck every file so I'm 100% I didn't make any mistake.
- Guide will be updated once I have the layout completed and thought of a proper way to explain it all.

If you need some help with using this project, head over to the Wiki.
